# First things First

**ATTENTION**  
This tool does not contain git or cloc. It just combines them! So you need to install both first before you can use this tool correctly!

ðŸ‘‰ [**Git**](https://git-scm.com/downloads)  
> `$ sudo apt install git-all`

ðŸ‘‰ [**Cloc**](https://github.com/AlDanial/cloc)  
> `$ sudo apt install cloc`

----

# Installation

If you are using linux, it's recommendet to clone the repository with
```
$ git clone https://github.com/zekroTJA/gitpluscloc
```
and then execute the `build.bash` script with
```
$ bash build.bash
```

On Windows, just compile the `gitpluscloc.cpp` with your favorite C++ compiller, put it somewhere you want and the set the PATH variable to use it globally.

----

# Usage

You can use every git command also with 'cgit', because the tool just passes the arguments directly to git. If you commit with 'cgit', it will automatically cloc in the current directory, creating a cloc file and adding it to the current branch. After, it will commit like git with the given arguments.

Example working path:
```
$ git add .
$ cgit commit -m "Added some stuff and fixed some bugs"
$ git push origin dev
```
